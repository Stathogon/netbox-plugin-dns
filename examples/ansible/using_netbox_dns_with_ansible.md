# Using NetBox DNS with Ansible
NetBox DNS aims to offer an easy to use and comfortable way of managing DNS data within NetBox. This document gives a brief introduction of how the data from NetBox DNS can be used to actually populate DNS servers with configuration and zones. This is not meant to be an exhaustive documentation of a DNS provisioning system ready for production, more to give an idea what can be done with NetBox DNS and the NetBox API.

This example uses Ansible and the `NetBox.NetBox` collection from Ansible Galaxy to show how a very simple integration can be implemented.

## Preparing NetBox
In order to use the NetBox API, a user account with an authentication token needs to be created. For the given purpose, a read-only user with access to the NetBox DNS data is sufficient.

Using the NetBox Admin interface, a new user named 'ansible' is created. The password is irrelevant and should be sufficiently secure - any random password of reasonable length will do.

In the next step, a permission to view all NetBox DNS data must be created and assigned to the user just created.

After sending that form, the new 'ansible' user can view all DNS data within NetBox. The last step is to assign that user an API authentication token. This can be done using the GAPI Token' navigation menu item by clicking on 'Add Token', selecting the 'ansible' user and unchecking 'Write enabled'. The token is shown immediately in that view.

## Preparing Ansible
For the `netbox.netbox` collection to work, a recent version of Ansible running under Python 3 is required. Python 2 is not supported anymore and the NetBox collection is known not to work properly with Python 2.

### Installing the `netbox.netbox` collection for Ansible
Installing the collection is straightforward.

```
# ansible-galaxy collection install netbox.netbox
Starting galaxy collection install process
Process install dependency map
Starting collection install process
Downloading https://galaxy.ansible.com/api/v3/plugin/ansible/content/published/collections/artifacts/netbox-netbox-3.17.0.tar.gz to /root/.ansible/tmp/ansible-local-219358jiz3hc9y/tmpgngehv3q/netbox-netbox-3.17.0-ywot9syj
Installing 'netbox.netbox:3.17.0' to '/root/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/netbox/netbox'
netbox.netbox:3.17.0 was installed successfully
```

### Installing the `pynetbox` Python 3 Module
The `netbox.netbox` collection requires the `pynetbox` module to be installed.

```
# pip3 install pynetbox

```

### Testing the API connection
Now the API connection can be tested by performing a simple lookup against NetBox. For the given purpose it is sufficient to use the `nb_lookup` plugin.

```
# ansible -m debug -a "msg={{Â query('netbox.netbox.nb_lookup', \
                                    'nameservers', \
                                    plugin='netbox_dns', \
                                    api_endpoint='https://netbox.example.com/', \
                                    token='f52d8887c576df4064139e4208cca481b95110f9') }}" localhost
```
The return value confirms that the user and its permissions are set up correctly and the token can be used to authenticate against NetBox and access data from NetBox DNS.

```
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "msg": [
        {
            "key": 1,
            "value": {
                "created": "2024-03-28T20:12:34.175720Z",
                "custom_fields": {},
                "description": "",
                "display": "ns1.example.com",
                "id": 1,
                "last_updated": "2024-03-28T20:12:34.175735Z",
                "name": "ns1.example.com",
                "tags": [],
                "tenant": null,
                "url": "https://netbox.example.com/api/plugins/netbox-dns/nameservers/1/",
                "zones": []
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Generating a zone file from NetBox DNS data
In the last step of this example, NetBox DNS data is used to create a zone file for e.g. a BIND nameserver.

#### Zone file template
A simple Jinja2 template to create a zone file is stored as `zone.db.j2`:

```
;
; Zone file for zone {{ zone.name }}
;

$TTL {{ zone.default_ttl }}

{% for record in records %}
{{ record.name.ljust(32) }}    {{ (record.ttl|string if record.ttl is not none else '').ljust(8) }} IN {{ record.type.ljust(8) }}    {{ record.value }}
{% endfor %}
```

#### Ansible playbook for creating a zone
A minimalistic playbook to create a zone from that template and the NetBox DNS data for the zone "example.com" used for the screenshots of this document can now be created as `create_zonefile.yml`:

```
#!/usr/bin/env ansible-playbook

- name: Create a sample zone file
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:

    - name: Create the zone file for zone {{ zone.name }}
      template:
          src: zone.db.j2
          dest: "{{ zone.name }}.db"
      vars:
          zone: "{{ query('netbox.netbox.nb_lookup', 'zones', plugin='netbox_dns',
                           api_endpoint='https://netbox.example.com/',
                           api_filter='name=zone1.example.com',
                           token='f52d8887c576df4064139e4208cca481b95110f9') 
                    | map(attribute='value') 
                    | first }}"
          records: "{{ query('netbox.netbox.nb_lookup', 'records', plugin='netbox_dns',
                             api_endpoint='https://netbox.example.com/',
                             api_filter='zone='+zone.name,
                             token='f52d8887c576df4064139e4208cca481b95110f9') 
                       | map(attribute='value') }}"
```

Running that playbook creates the zone file from the data in the NetBox DNS:

```
# ./create-zonefile.yml 
PLAY [Create a sample zone file] ************************************************************************************
TASK [Gathering Facts] **********************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create the zone file for zone zone1.example.com] **************************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP **********************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
```

As a result, a very minimal but valid zone file is created:

```
;
; Zone file for zone zone1.example.com
;

$TTL 86400

@                                            IN NS          ns1.example.com.
@                                            IN NS          ns2.example.com.
@                                   86400    IN SOA         ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. 1712577231 172800 7200 2592000 3600
```

#### Updating zone data
Now some data can be added and the playbook run again to see what changes will be observed.

![Updated Records per Zone](images/ZoneRecordsUpdated.png)

After running the playbook again, the resulting zone file now looks like this:

```
;
; Zone file for zone zone1.example.com
;

$TTL 86400

@                                            IN NS          ns1.example.com.
@                                            IN NS          ns2.example.com.
@                                   86400    IN SOA         ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. 1712577644 172800 7200 2592000 3600
name01                                       IN A           10.0.0.1
name02                                       IN A           10.0.0.2
name03                                       IN A           10.0.0.3
name04                                       IN A           10.0.0.4
name05                                       IN A           10.0.0.5
name1                                        IN A           10.0.0.1
name2                                        IN A           10.0.0.2
name3                                        IN A           10.0.0.3
name4                                        IN A           10.0.0.4
name5                                        IN A           10.0.0.5
test1                                        IN CNAME       test1.zone1.example.com.
```

The new records have been inserted and the zone SOA SERIAL is updated in the SOA record.
